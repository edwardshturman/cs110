# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

In an effort to be more open about my code, I'm publishing my work as I go along in CS110, an intro computer science course at University of San Francisco.

Here, you'll find projects, labs, and in-class exercises throughout the course, which goes until December 16, 2021.

As a JavaScript developer, I'm loving how intuitive Python's been so far, and I look forward to creating some epic stuff here!
