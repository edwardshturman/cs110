# Write a program percentages.py that asks the user for the number of CS majors and the number of non-CS majors
# registered in a class. The program should display the percentage of CS majors and non-CS majors in the class to 2
# decimal places along with the % sign with no space.
#
# Hint: Suppose there are 8 CS majors and 12 non-CS majors in a class. There are 20 students in the class. The
# percentage of CS majors can be calculated as 8 รท 20 = 0.4, or 40%. The percentage of non-CS majors can be
# calculated as 12 รท 20 = 0.6, or 60%.
