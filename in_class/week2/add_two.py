# Write a Python program add_two.py that takes a user's input into a variable and adds 2 to it. Steps for the
# algorithm are:
# Ask for input for an integer, call the variable x.
# Add two to x.
# Print out 'The value of x+2 is: ' and the value of x+2.


x = int(input('Pick a number, any number! '))
print('The value of x + 2 is:', x + 2)
