# Each year of a dog's life is equivalent to about seven years of a human's life.
# Write a Python program (dog_years.py) that converts dog years to human years.
# Steps for the algorithm are:
# Ask for input for the dog's age with 'Dog age?'
# Print the human years on the screen in this format:
# 'Age in human years: ' and the dog's age calculated in human years.

# Extra credit:
# What is the command to find the 'Zen of Python' in the Python Shell?
# You can enter your answer at the end of your dog_years.py file as a comment using a hashtag like this:
# Answer to EC is: _______
# And enter your favorite line from the 'Zen of Python' like this:
# Favorite line from Zen of Python is _______


dog_age = int(input('Dog age? '))
human_age = (dog_age * 7)
print('Age in human years:', human_age)

# Answer to EC: import this
# Favorite line: 'Now is better than never.'
# Clich√© but applicable to many aspects of life outside of programming. :)
